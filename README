Victory shall be ours!

Our Lambdaman is written in a beautiful lisp, compiled down (in an actual lisp,
sbcl) to gcc code. Writing necessary standard library from scratch was fun. 

Lambdaman is cautious, keeping its distance from active ghosts at a distance
and usin A* to evaluate the map, the next targets and ghost threat.

AI for the ghost is universal one, it tries somewhat agressively to target
Lambdaman; as a ghost0 it tracks the position of lambdaman; 1 - right
underneath it, 2 - right of the lambdaman and 3 - to the left of lambdaman,
making 4 of these ghosts into a pack of quite painful hound dogs.

Ghost compiler is written in OCaml (required opam packages: core, menhir) and
the ghost code itself is written in an ad-hoc post-assembly language
vaguely resembling some ugly grandmother of C.
